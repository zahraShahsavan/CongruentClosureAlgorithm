This is an implementation of congruent closure algorithm to find if a statement satisfiable or not and is implemented by JVM 21.0.2.
to test it please put the formulas in the formulas.txt file.
There is a config in application.properties that you can enable or disable the heuristics.
After setting up the jvm and application.properties and put the formulas in the formulas.txt and use this command to execute the solver.

java -jar CCSolver-1.0.jar

The output of algorithm is in the output.txt file.
There are some sample formulas in formulas test to test the solver and all of them are from notes of ar classes.
